#RainCat - Lesson 2
This is the end of day code for RainCat lesson 2. 

In this lesson we covered: 

- Adding in the umbrella object to keep our cat dry from the rain
- Beginning collision detection with *categoryBitMask* and *contactTestBitMask*
- Reworking collision detection, so raindrops wonâ€™t pile up
- Creating a world boundary to remove nodes from the scene correctly
